Preprocessing in PyTorch</b></i></p>


We introduce **P3Tracer**, a specialized profiling tool for PyTorch preprocessing pipelines. 

**P3Tracer** is a easy-to-use, low overhead, visualization-ready and  profiler specialized for the widely used PyTorch framework.

## About P3Tracer

P3Tracer employs two novel approaches:

1. **P3Torch** - An instrumentation methodology for the PyTorch library, which enables fine-grained elapsed time profiling with minimal time and storage overheads. 
2. **P3Map** - A mapping methodology to reconstruct a mapping between Python functions and the underlying C++ functions they call, effectively linking high-level Python functions with low-level hardware counters. 

Above combination is powerful as it allows enables users to better reason about their pipelineâ€™s performance, both at the level of preprocessing operations and their performance on hardware resource usage.

## How to get P3Tracer

1. Clone this repository
2. Get submodules:

    ```git
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```
3. Create a conda environment

    ```bash
    conda create -n P3Tracer python=3.10
    conda activate P3Tracer
    ```
4. Install Intel VTune from here.

    Note: we used `Intel(R) VTune(TM) Profiler 2024.0.1 (build 627177)`
5. Install CUDA 11.8 from [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-8-0-download-archive) and CuDNN 8.7.0 from [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive)
6. Follow the **P3Torch** build instructions in `code/P3Torch/README.md`
7. Follow the **itt-python** build instructions in `code/itt-python/README.md`
8. That's it!

## How to use P3Tracer

### How to use P3Torch


**P3Torch** can be enabled by simply passing a `custom_log_file` to be used by **P3Torch** using keywords `log_transform_elapsed_time` and `log_file` as shown below:

```python
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
import torchvision.datasets as datasets
custom_log_file = <To use our instrumentation>
train_dataset = datasets.ImageFolder(
    traindir,
    transforms.Compose([
        transforms.RandomResizedCrop(224),
        transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),
        transforms.ToTensor(),
        transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406],
                std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
    ], log_transform_elapsed_time=custom_log_file), 
    log_file=custom_log_file
)
train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(
    train_dataset,
    batch_size=args.batch_size,
    shuffle=(train_sampler is None) and args.shuffle,
    num_workers=args.workers,
    pin_memory=True,
    sampler=train_sampler,
)
```

But, what if you have a custom dataset?

We do support **P3Torch** for custom datasets as well check below instance:


```python
log_file = <To use our instrumentation>
transforms = transforms.Compose([
  op1(), op2(), op3(), op4()], 
  log_transform_elapsed_time=log_file)
class CustomDataset:
  def __init__(self, log_file = None, transforms):
    ...
    self.log_file = log_file # If None, then no logging
    self.transforms = transforms # A Compose object
    ...
  def __getitem__(self, index):
    ...
    data,label = self.transforms(index) # Calls Compose's __call__()
    ...
    return data, label
dataset = CustomDataset(log_file = log_file, transforms = transforms)
```

You simply need to add `self.log_file` and `self.transforms` variable in `__init__` function of your custom dataset object as shown above. 
Moreover, you need to structure the code such that you use torchvision's `Compose` class' object to perform preprocessing operations as shown in `self.transforms(index)` line. That's it!

### How to use P3Map

Below is an example of how to write a program such that using **P3Map** will enable collection of mapping: 

```python
import torchvision.transforms as t
from PIL import Image
import time,itt
# increase PIL image open size
Image.MAX_IMAGE_PIXELS = 1000000000
image_file = "<path to image>"
for i in range(5):
  # Open the image
  image = Image.open(image_file)
  # convert to RGB like torch's pil_loader
  image = image.convert('RGB') # Responisble for Loader operation
  # Define the desired crop size
  crop_size = 224  # Define this as needed
  time.sleep(1)  # sleep for 1 sec
  if i == 4: # Delay collection to prevent cold start
    itt.resume()
  image = t.RandomResizedCrop(crop_size)(image)
  if i == 4:
    itt.detach()
```

## Concrete examples

### Example for P3Torch

An example of how to enable **P3Torch** facilitated logging for an image classification task has been described in `code/image_classification/code/pytorch_main.py`, we add the snippet below for the same:

```python
normalize = transforms.Normalize(
    mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
)
train_dataset = datasets.ImageFolder(
    traindir,
    transforms.Compose(
        [
            transforms.RandomResizedCrop(224),
            transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),
            transforms.ToTensor(),
            normalize,
        ],	
        log_transform_elapsed_time=args.log_train_file,
    ),
    log_file=args.log_train_file,
)
```

Notice that the user simply has to pass the same log file to be used by **P3Torch** using keywords `log_transform_elapsed_time` and `log_file`.

### Example for P3Map
