# How to contribute to the repo


This file will be updated periodically to reflect how to contribute.

For now, simply create a branch called `dev_<your_github_username>` and start adding your code to it.

Before merging your branch's pull request to `main` branch, first document what is being added/changed and finally get it reviewed by someone.
